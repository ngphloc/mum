Dear sir / madam

Congratulate your journal for successes in prints publishing.

Publishing a book is my dream and so I am very happy to receive your invitation and much more happy to send you my book "A User Modeling System for Adaptive Learning" (232 pages). The book has two differences: firstly, the book introduces my innovative works in user modeling, secondly, I built up a computer software (user modeling server) associated to the book.

You can download entire book and software following link https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByHQY9CungG-OGtyRHYzUzR3YzQ/edit?usp=sharing

The attached are publication proposal form, the book, the abstract and my CV.

Thank you very much

Dear sir/madam

Thank you very much for wonderful format. I love it.
Although this is the first edition, I want it to be perfect. So there are two modifications now as follows:
1. Enhancing section III.2-Learning style sub-model, focusing on hidden Markov model.
2. Enhancing sub-section III.3.1.2-A proposal of breaking sequential pattern in learning context, focusing sequential pattern example.
All other sub-sections and sections are not changed. I try my best to finish these modifications with two weeks.
So you should not modify anymore until I send the revised version. Following are some first suggestions:
The header information is changed according to odd page and even page as follows:
- Odd page header shows chapter name, for example: "Chapter III. Three sub-models in Triangular Learner Model".
- Even page header shows section name, for example: "III.1. Knowledge sub-model".
The header of first page of the section always shows section name regardless of odd page or even page.
We should keep hyperlinks of tables, figures, and formulas. Important appendices such as "List of Tables", "List of Figures", and "List of Formulas" must be kept.
I am inquiring postdoctoral fellowship budget for publishing payment because this book is the main result of the postdoctoral research. So the payment will be paid very soon.
Thank you so much, your format is very pretty
Cheers

Dear sir/madam
Thank you very much for kind response. I understand your feeling.
When choosing open access model publishing, I want to achieve two purposes:
1- You help me to achieve fame in science. You spread my work over the world much better than me do. This is the biggest award for my contribution to science. Larg impact on science is very important to me.
2- I achieve more profit from the fame in science, for example: getting fund for work, doing project. The profit can be much more than selling bonus. As I said, this gives me a lot of true profits from sweet heart and loyalty with respect to science.
Now I am applying for postdoctoral fellowship. A large amout of the fellowship fund is reserved for publishing this book. However my application is not finished yet because of some requirements. Of course I will received the fund award because of excellent research but the schedule may be delayed out of our expectation while I want to publish the book as soon as possible. If I focus on revising the book, it will be completed for 1-2 months because there is no more invention in the first edition. Beside revising the book, I am trying my best to receive the award fund and so the due date is June 1 (for 3 months). I can not afford the publication fee on account now (around 15,000$). However my biggest inspiration is to publish the book.
So please waiting for me to complete the book and I receive the fund award recently.
Cheers

Subject: Suspend the publication of the book until next years (2017 or 2018)
To: book@scirp.org
Date: May 25, 2016

Dear Sir/Madam
Thank you very much for kind remind.
I have received your previous email. I apologize you for late payment.
I understand your effort and situation. Many thanks to you again for helping me and giving me many chances.
I confirm that I desire to publish the book in our publisher.
This is my biggest honor and happiness, which is also the most important in my research career.
However now I cannot afford the publication fee.
I suggest we suspend the publication of the book until next years (2017 or 2018).
Now I am extremely worried because I am in a stalemate. I am not still confident as in previous emails I sent you because I cannot gain fund now.
Perhaps my spirit goes downhill very much. I received many your emails but I am afraid of replying you.

Please giving me a chance of payment in next years.
Of course, I understand your dissatification when you help me many times but I do not bear the responsibility yet.
Please sympathize with me when the payment fee is a big mount of money for me now. Really, I cannot afford it now.
Best regards,
