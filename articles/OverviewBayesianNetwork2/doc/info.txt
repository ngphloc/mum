Dear Mr. Mateo Pulko and Prof. Shaheed Naseem,
I cannot finish the chapter "Overview of Bayesian Network" in time when it is too long to be a chapter and it takes me a lot of efforts to complete it. ALternately, I focus on collaborating with Prof. Shaheed Naseem to complete the chapter "Patient Bayesian Inference: Cloud-based Healthcare Data Analysis using Constraint-based Adaptive Boost Algorithm" as a coauthor.

However, I do not want to make you in trouble and I also do not miss the opportunity to publish the work "Overview of Bayesian Network". Therefore, I will re-submit the work "Overview of Bayesian Network" as the monograph (short book). Quality of the book project "Bayesian Inference" is not decreased because the chapter "Patient Bayesian Inference: Cloud-based Healthcare Data Analysis using Constraint-based Adaptive Boost Algorithm" is very good whereas the work "Overview of Bayesian Network" is too long. I will re-submit the book preparation form to you very soon.

Of course, I try my best to collaborate with Prof. Shaheed Naseem to complete that chapter "Patient Bayesian Inference: Cloud-based Healthcare Data Analysis...".
Many thanks to you again for your enthusiastic support.
Best regards,
